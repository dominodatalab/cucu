Feature: File upload
  As a developer I want to make sure the test writer can upload files to a
  web application

  Scenario: User can upload a file
    Given I start a webserver at directory "data/www" and save the port to the variable "PORT"
      And I open a browser at the url "http://{HOST_ADDRESS}:{PORT}/files.html"
     When I upload the file "features/browser/file_upload.feature" to the file input "upload some files:"
      And I click the button "upload!"
      And I save the current url to the variable "URL"
     Then I should see "{URL}" matches ".*\?filename=file_upload.feature"

  Scenario: User can drag and drop to upload a file
    Given I start a webserver at directory "data/www" and save the port to the variable "PORT"
      And I open a browser at the url "http://{HOST_ADDRESS}:{PORT}/drag_drop.html"
     When I wait to drag and drop the file "features/browser/file_upload.feature" to "Click or drag file to this area to upload"
     Then I wait to see the text "File dropped: file_upload.feature"
